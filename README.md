Let's say we want to find cracked servers with at least 2 players online. Because of this I am setting "Cracked" to "Yes" and "Online Players" to "At least 2"   <br />
The mod searches servers automatically for your current Minecraft version.    <br />

After clicking on "Find", we can now just add all servers  <br />
