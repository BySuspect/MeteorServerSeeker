Let's say we want to find cracked servers with at least 2 players online. Because of this I am setting "Cracked" to "Yes" and "Online Players" to "At least 2"  
The mod searches servers automatically for your current Minecraft version.

After clicking on "Find", we can now just add all servers

Let's say we want to find the player with the name "DAM". We just type "DAM" into the box, and click on "Find Player"
